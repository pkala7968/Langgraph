Subject: So sorry I missed your party!

Hi Manas,

I'm so incredibly sorry I missed your party last Friday! I was really looking forward to it and was genuinely disappointed that I couldn't make it. I hope you had an absolutely fantastic time and celebrated in style.

I'd love to hear all about it! Let's definitely catch up soon. Perhaps we could grab coffee or lunch next week?

Best,
Pratyush
