Subject: Absence Request - Pratyush - Math

Dear Abhay,

I am writing to inform you that I will be unable to attend school tomorrow, 9 November, as I am feeling unwell. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

I will do my best to catch up on any missed work as soon as I am able. Please let me know if there are any specific assignments or materials I should review.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,
Pratyush
